          Senior QA Engineer turned Software Developer with 5 years of
          experience in manual and automated testing. Recently completed a
          full-time Software Development Bootcamp at Northcoders, where I built
          full-stack JavaScript applications using React, Node.js, and
          databases, with a strong focus on test-driven development. Skilled in
          Cypress, writing test cases, and building automation scripts, plus
          hands-on coding experience from the bootcamp. Now looking to apply my
          QA background and new development skills to build and ship
          high-quality software solutions.
